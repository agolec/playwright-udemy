Sites to use
reqres.in - A live realtime APi service. Free to use.

Gives real response info and doesn't require registration.

Best Practices:

Put your base URL into it's own variable because you will refer back to it a LOT.

How to Perform API validations

1) Assert the response you received is the correct one.

Ex: if you expect 404 or 200, perform an assert on the status.

practical example: 

const response = await request.get(`${baseURL}/users/2`)
        expect(response.status()).toBe(GOOD)

2) Parsing Response JSON data, and validate contents.

            How to parse.

1- create a variable like  responseBody, and 
2- use JSON.parse on it.

ex: 

        const responseBody = JSON.parse(await response.text())
        console.log(responseBody)

    the console.log will output the following:

    {
        data: {
            id: 2,
            email: 'janet.weaver@reqres.in',
            first_name: 'Janet',
            last_name: 'Weaver',
            avatar: 'https://reqres.in/img/faces/2-image.jpg'
        },
        support: {
            url: 'https://reqres.in/#support-heading',
            text: 'To keep ReqRes free, contributions towards server costs are appreciated!'
        }
    }
